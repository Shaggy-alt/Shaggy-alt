### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  Most of my projects here will be related to cybersec with pen-testing in mind. 
I will show most if not all my projects I have done since I began 2 years ago with instruction on how to replicate. 

I will also show how to use certain well known tools in unknown ways to evade detection (nmap im looking at you..)
